I've never thought it'd be worthwhile to blog, but what the hell, GitHub and Jekyll make it way too easy to not do it. I'll be posting about things ranging from the latest music I've been listening to and anything tech/programming related, to writing about the weird YouTube videos I've scavenged from my lastest mining adventure(you know the side of YouTube I'm talking about). Hopefully you learn about some new stuff from a different perspective :)
